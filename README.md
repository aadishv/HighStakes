# Aadish's 315P code

From October 2023 to November 2024, I ([Aadish Verma](aadishv.github.io)) was the lead (and, often, only) coder of the VEX V5 Robotics Competition team [315P Paradigm](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/V5RC/315P). This role lasted over two seasons, two programming languages, and multiple paradigm shifts. The current code is under a different owner ([staryskies](https://github.com/staryskies), who apparently also recently left the team). This repository is a static clone of the codebase at the time of my leaving the team. It is intended as a reference of one of the many codebases I have worked on. This code uses the PROS VEX framework with C++ and the VOSS high-level API.

This uses the MIT license so feel free to clone and use it as you wish. Cheers!
